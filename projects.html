										<h1>Troy Story</h1>
									</header>
									<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/TroyStory.png" alt="" /></span>-->
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/TroyStory.png" alt="" /></span><p>Over ten grueling years of war, filled with bloodshed and endless skirmishes, the Greeks turned to their very last trick to try and break the siege of Troy. Over three days and nights, they construct a larger-than-life wooden horse and secretly hide a  group of their best warriors within it. Deceived by the apparent gift, the Trojans take the horse into their walls, giving the Greeks access to the city, allowing them to open the great walls of Troy, and take the city. Like the great construct of myth, this equine sculpture hides all of its mechanisms within. As the Greeks, revealed by the door, ready for battle, the horse tosses its head and shakes its tail, rearing for battle.</p>
									<p>In a team comprised of four others, we were assigned the task of creating a sculpture that utilized a variety of mechanical movements all driven by a single motor and gear chain. We were also given the theme of "Myths and Legends", and were drawn to the legend of the Trojan Horse. Constructed mainly of plywood and laser-cut acrylic painted to look like wood, Troy Story also features 3D-printed gears and mechanisms, plasma-cut steel, and rastered decorations. This horse proved to be an incredible learning experience in terms of fabrication, creative problem solving, and teambuilding.</p>
									<p>From afar, this sculpture is simply the outline of a wooden horse. But closer inspection shows that it’s more than what meets the eye. Like the Trojan Horse after which it was modeled, Troy Story hides secrets within it. All the mechanisms used to drive the movements in the horse are housed within the confines of the horse outline. A four bar linkage moves the head up and down in a natural arc, while a slot slider in the back moves the tail in a similar motion. At the center of the horse, a door opens and closes to reveal a Greek warrior inside, ready for battle.</p>
									<p>The warrior is pushed back and forth by a slot slider, but also runs along a stationary cam. The cam pushes the warrior in a motion that resembles him wavering back and forth, preparing to exit the Trojan Horse and lay seige to Troy. The door is pulled by a string that runs inside the horse and to a pausing slot slider. This mechanism lets the string slack to open the door, then pauses, leaving the door open, before pulling the string back in and closing it. Even the materials aren’t what they seem in this decieving sculpture, with a body made of plain plywood but a head and tail made of painted acrylic. Heavy aesthetic wheels add to the Trojan Horse energy of the sculpture, along with helping it balance.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/TroyStoryHeadDrawing.png" alt="" /></span><p>The motor is mounted in the middle body panel, towards the front of the horse. A gear is driven directly from the motor, and meshes with a larger gear at the front of the horse to drive the main shaft for the pausing slot slider. The slider moves in a circular pattern, while a slot shaped like an arc with two notches on the end follows it. The shape of the slot allows the motion created to have a lull of movement in the middle, which lets the door that it controls stay open for a short period of time. From the top of the slot piece extends a verticle pole, with a hole at the top. A string runs through this hole, then through a plastic tube at a right angle, and finally to the door. The right angle piece helps the string run in the right directions, translating the up and down motion from the pausing slot slider into a pull on the door.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/TroyStory4Bar.png" alt="" /></span><p>Also along this shaft is a gear that meshes with the gear which powers the four bar linkage shaft. The linkage moves one half of the horse head directly, pushing it in an arc that looks like the horse is bowing its head back and forth. The other half of the horse’s head is attached to the first by a brass piece of tubing secured with retaining rings. The use of spacers, spring pins, and retaining rings ensures that everything stays in place and doesn’t interfere with the other parts. </p>
									<p>A chain drive links the gear off of the motor to a sprocket at the back of the horse after passing over a tensioner. This sprocket is attatched to a gear that drives the shaft for the warrior mechanisms. A horizontal scottish yoke pushes the warrior back and forth behind the opening for the door. However, the warrior is mounted to a vertical cam follower, which has freedom to slide up and down while the slot slider pushes it. By running over a stationary cam, the warrior piece appears to move in a back and forth motion that looks like he’s preparing for battle. </p>
									<p>From the gear driving the warrior’s Scottish yoke, a smaller gear is driven that turns the shaft for the tail slot slider. As the tail slider turns, it moves the tail up and down in a linear motion. However, due to the pivot point of the tail pieces, the tail appears to flick out and back in like a horse’s would.</p>

										<h1>Observatory</h1>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Observatory.png" alt="" /></span></p><p>With a large, galaxy-adorned disc spinning behind the cross section of an observatory, our sculpture is hard to miss. A swiveling telescope and moving decoration of the hand of God complete the visible moving components. Our sculpture focuses on a central theme from throughout the Renaissance: that of science against religion. This theme is most plainly reflected in the acrylic piece at the front of the sculpture, where the hand of God reaches out to touch a nebula. Inside the observatory, a man sits and watches the sky, thinking about what he sees. The massive telescope of the observatory swings in a great arc, focusing in and out at the stars by running over a stationary cam.</p>
									<p>The large spinning background of our sculpture is the culmination of many hours of hard work. Driven by gears, sprockets, and a chain, the disc spins at the perfect speed to capture the feeling of watching the stars pass through the sky overhead. The sculpture is held up on a black plywood box, which has no front wall, but does have a middle divider and back wall to support many features of the sculpture. The main motor is mounted in the back right of the base box, supported by two metal brackets. A gear with a radius of 0.58in is connected directly to the motor, and then to another gear with radius 1.5in. The larger gear is on the main central axle for the sculpture. Also along this axle is a 16 tooth sprocket. This sprocket is connected via a chain to a 32 tooth sprocket vertically above it, on the axle which spins the large back plate. The chain also runs around a tensioner This set of gears, sprockets, chain, and the disc is the gear chain which gave us the most trouble. Julia worked hard to find the right parameters to ensure the disc didn’t spin too quickly, along with lining up motor placement and the length of the chain. It ended up becoming a much harder task than originally anticipated, and ran beyond our deadlines of when we wanted to have the CAD model completed by. Plywood supports were constructed to hold up the back plate, along with hiding some of the gear transmissions for a clean and finished look.</p>
									<p>I wanted to make sure I understood all the mechanics of the sculpture and how they interacted. I continually asked questions to make sure my understanding was at the level I wanted. Another goal I set was to do plenty of CAD and get more experience with it.</p>

										<h1>Cat Automata</h1>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AutomataFinal.png" alt="" /></span><p>This project involved designing and fabricating a crank-driven automata that simulated an organic movement. I chose to imitate the movements of a cat swiping its paw through the air, which proved to be a unique challenge to achieve.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/AutomataSketch.png" alt="" /></span><p>Rather than a simpler four-bar linkage, I chose to utilize a six-bar linkage as my mechanism, attaching to a gear with a handle for turning. The six-bar linkage moves the paw of the cat in a small circular motion. I chose this mechanism because, from the start, I was very set on reproducing a completely natural-looking movement. A four-bar linkage didn’t give me the movement I was looking for, and so I took on the challenge of creating a six-bar linkage instead.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AutomataArmSketch.png" alt="" /></span><p>This project taught me a lot about scoping and precision. I originally overscoped my project, with a vision of a dinosaur that bent forward and closed its jaws to eat a coin like a mechanical bank. When I started work on this automata, I realized quickly that it was beyond my ability to finish with my current skills and time frame. Instead, I shifted to an idea I’d had before the dinosaur, the cat swiping at a toy. I still set a challenge for myself: creating the most realistic movement I could. Most of the time I spent on this project was dedicated to figuring out the right spacing and distances for the linkage. By turning the handle, the cat’s paw moves up, then swipes forward in a downward arc. Because I chose the elbow and shoulder as rotation points, I had to ensure that the paw would never flip the arm backward or otherwise move in an unnatural way. Adjusting the numbers for this linkage was time-consuming and frustrating, but taught me a lot about how these mechanisms work. </p>
